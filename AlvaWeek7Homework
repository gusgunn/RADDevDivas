	//Assignment:  The following static method is supposed to create the number of accounts specified in the argument provided.
	//Each Account should be named 'Sample Account #sampleNumber'  where sample number is the count.  So if you created 2 Accounts
	//one would be called 'Sample Account 1' and the other 'Sample Account 2'

	//Also, when we're done inserting them, we will create a case for each one with a Status of 'New', Origin of 'New Account' and the
	//desription and subject of your choice.  

	//This isn't working quite right.  Can you use your debugging skills to fix it?  I had to comment it out since it won't compile
	//Look out for consistency and formatting too!  (even if they don't break the code)
	//Add comments to describe what the code is doing.
	//After you get it to compile, run it in execute anonymous and check that it's really working!

	public static void createSampleAccounts (Decimal numberOfAccounts) {

		List < Account > acctList = new List < Account >();
		for (Integer i = 0; i <= numberOfAccounts; i++) {
			Account a = new Account();
			a.Name = ('Sample Account ' + i);
         	system.debug(a.Name);
		}

		insert acctList;

		List < Case > casesToInsert = new List < Case >();
		//line below: there was type: accctList
		for (Account a: acctList) {
			Case c = new Case();
			c.Status = 'New'; //missing ' ' 
			c.Origin = 'New Account'; // missing ;
			c.AccountId = a.Id; //added .Id since it's referencing Account associated with Case
			c.Subject = ('New Case') ; 
			c.Description = 'Follow Up'; // typo 'description' and remove extra = : originally == which is an equal operator
			casesToInsert.add(c);
            system.debug(c.Subject);
