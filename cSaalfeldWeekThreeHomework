	//1.  Your Assignment is to write a brand new method below that calls the private method that is already written.  You don't need to 
	//know exactly how it works, we'll cover SOQL queries later, but take a look and you'll likely get the gist
	//What's important to know is that when called it will return a list of top Accounts based on revenue, returning no more than 10.

	//Write a method that uses a For Loop to loop through the returned list and update the Priority__c field on those accounts to be 'High'
	//Be sure to use DML to update the records! 


	private static List < Account > getTopTenAccounts () {

		List < Account > topAccounts = [SELECT ID, Name, AnnualRevenue FROM Account WHERE AnnualRevenue!=NULL AND AnnualRevenue!=0 ORDER BY AnnualRevenue DESC LIMIT 10];

		return topAccounts;
