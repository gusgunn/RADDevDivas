	//Assignment:  The following static method is supposed to create the number of accounts specified in the argument provided.
	//Each Account should be named 'Sample Account #sampleNumber'  where sample number is the count.  So if you created 2 Accounts
	//one would be called 'Sample Account 1' and the other 'Sample Account 2'

	//Also, when we're done inserting them, we will create a case for each one with a Status of 'New', Origin of 'New Account' and the
	//desription and subject of your choice.  

	//This isn't working quite right.  Can you use your debugging skills to fix it?  I had to comment it out since it won't compile
	//Look out for consistency and formatting too!  (even if they don't break the code)
	//Add comments to describe what the code is doing.
	//After you get it to compile, run it in execute anonymous and check that it's really working!

	public static void createSampleAccounts (Integer numberOfAccounts) {

    //create a list to hold new accounts
		List<Account> acctList = new List <Account>();
		
    //iterate through numberofAccounts times and create that many accounts, then add them to acctList
    for (Integer i = 1; i <= numberOfAccounts; i++) {
			Account a = new Account();
			a.Name = 'Sample Account ' + i;
      acctList.add(a);
		}

    //insert new accounts
		insert acctList;

		//create a list to hold new cases
    List <Case> casesToInsert = new List <Case>();

		//iterate through accounts just created and create a new case for each, then add to casesToInsert
    for (Account a: acctList) {
			Case c = new Case();
			c.Status = 'New';
			c.Origin = 'New Account';
