        /*Next project: how to add them in the right increments automatically
       	Something like: 
			add an item to the list that has the value of last index + last index -1
			but only while the list size is less than 20
			otherwise, infinite loop
		In Python, you get the last item in a list like this: numberList[-1] 
		but that doesn't work here, I tried
		And Googling didn't turn up a direct way to find that value, either
		You could work around like this:
			While (numberList.size() < 20) {
				//get the list size
				//get the value of the index at [list size - 1]
				//get the value of the index at [list size - 2]
				//add those two values
				//add that value to the end of the list
				//check list size for <20
				//if list size <20, repeat 1-5
				//if list size >=20, end loop
			};
			system.debug('here is my awesome list of fibonacci numbers: ' +numberList);

	But I digress. Some other time.
