	//1.  Your Assignment is to write a brand new method below that calls the private method that is already written.  You don't need to 
	//know exactly how it works, we'll cover SOQL queries later, but take a look and you'll likely get the gist
	//What's important to know is that when called it will return a list of top Accounts based on revenue, returning no more than 10.

	//Write a method that uses a For Loop to loop through the returned list and update the Priority__c field on those accounts to be 'High'
	//Be sure to use DML to update the records! 

    	private static List < Account > getTopTenAccounts () {

		List < Account > topAccounts = [SELECT ID, Name, AnnualRevenue FROM Account WHERE AnnualRevenue!=NULL AND AnnualRevenue!=0 ORDER BY AnnualRevenue DESC LIMIT 10];

		return topAccounts;
	}
    
      public static void updatePriority(){
    
		  List < Account > newAccountList = new List <Account> ();
        
      //Write a new method that calls the private method
      newAccountList = getTopTenAccounts();
        
      //Make a For Loop to loop through the list from the private method
      for (Account a: newAccountList)
         //update the Priority field on these accounts to 'High'
            a.Priority__c = 'High';
                
      //Update accounts using DML
      update newAccountList;
                    
      //Check to make sure the For loop worked correctly
      system.debug('Updated Accounts:' + newAccountList);
    }
