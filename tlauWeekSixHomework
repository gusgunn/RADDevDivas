Object Oriented Classes

Item:
1. How would you instantiate a new Item?  (Type in the proper syntax -- Test yourself using Execute Anonymous)
Item i = new Item(300,.2,'Roomba','Vacuum');

2. Why do you have to pass in the required variables?
The constructor method requires the variables in order to run and create the new object.

3. What happens if you pass in a discount of more than 1 (100%)?
Although there is language for throwing an exception, nothing seems to happen...yet. I suspect when we try to use DML, this will have some effect.

ShoppingCart:
1. Describe the relationship between the Item class and ShoppingCart class?
The shopping cart includes a list of items, as well as a few other cart-specific attributes.

2. How would you instantiate a new ShoppingCart?  (Type in the proper syntax -- Test yourself using Execute Anonymous)
ShoppingCart s = new ShoppingCart(35);

2a. Can you create and add an item to the cart?
Item i = new Item(300,.2,'Roomba','Vacuum');
s.addItem(i);

3. What are some other methods that might be helpful to have on ShoppingCart ?
remove one item, specify/update quantity (multiples of same item), display a user-friendly list of items and prices, apply a cart-wide discount


Static vs. Non Static Methods

1. What is the main syntax difference between calling this static method, and what you had to do to call a method on our Shopping cart class above, like adding an item?
Here, I just called the method. For the items and shopping carts, I had to create a new instance of the object before calling the method.

2. How would you describe the main difference between a static and non-static method?
A static method can be called without creating an object. A non-static method can only be called on an object after creating that object.
